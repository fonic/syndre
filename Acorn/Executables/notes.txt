Syndicate+ Acorn RISC OS Executable:

Executable does not seem to contain ANY human-readable strings, which suggests
that there might be some sort of compression or obfuscation going on (or an
encoding that does NOT rely on byte boundaries (e.g. something like 26-bit
values, which apparently was the original machine's bitness; see https://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/26-bit_computing)

-> Executable format (AIF, ARM Image Format) is described here:
   https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0041/c/ARM-Image-Format

-> Are there any hex editors / file viewers for Acorn RISC OS that might
   allow further inspection?

-> Might this simply be an ENDIANNESS issue?
